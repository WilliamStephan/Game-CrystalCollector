Crystals Collector

After going very deep in the last homework assignment I opted for a different approach on the jQuery Crystals Collectors assignment. My goal was to recreate the exact functionality shown in the video example (flawed as it was).

My internal challenge was trying to put the maximum amount of program logic inside the two object classes. I ended with only 13 lines of (jQuery/javaScript) code outside the object methods. 

The most interesting part of the project was creating the four gem objects dynamically by iterating their HTML class and loading them into a single array of objects. Not sure if Iâ€™ll ever need that methodology for a real-life project, but it made the project interesting. 

I also added some base functionality to eliminate duplicate random values from the gem objects. Not in the spec, but seemed appropriate.
